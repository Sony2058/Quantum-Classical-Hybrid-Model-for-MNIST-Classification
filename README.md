# Quantum-Classical-Hybrid-Model-for-MNIST-Classification
This project implements a quantum-classical hybrid neural network using TorchQuantum to classify MNIST handwritten digits (focused on distinguishing between 3 and 6). The code integrates classical preprocessing with quantum layers for training and testing on a subset of MNIST.
